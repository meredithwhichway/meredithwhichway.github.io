##### Discovery isn't about building software ###

Discovery work isn't about building shippable software. It's about learning. It's about building a deeper understanding of what we could build. It's about asking and answering questions like:
* What _problems_ are we really solving?
* What solutions could be _valuable_ to our organization and to customers buying or adopting the product?
* What does a _usable_ solution look like?
* What's _feasible_ to build given the time and tools that we have?
