Once the crewmen remembered what we were doing and why, they would do anything to support the mission. This was a stark contrast to earlier, when people were coming to work simply with the hope of not screwing up.

First, we needed to create a work environment that would give the men respect and dignity; a place they were happy to go each day.

* Instead of focusing on intimate review of the work, I focused on intimate review of the people.
* Instead of requiring more reports and more inspection points, I required fewer.
