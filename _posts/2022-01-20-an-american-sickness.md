The doctors of the society, political neophytes all, took out an advertisement in the local newspaper to propose a list of bold cost-saving ideas. They should be music to many patient's ears. 
1. Price transparency should be mandated: "The difficulty in obtaining the cost or price of medical care should end. These should be very easy to obtain. _Doctors are as ignorant as patients as to these prices and hospitals should teach doctors and patients these prices, not hide them._"
2. Not-for-profit hospitals _"should be not-for-profit._ Period. These organizations currently hide large profits in excessive executive compensation, excessive lavish building projects, bloated foundations, and other 'shell games.' ... If they invest in fancy new facilities that cannot be financed by more modest charges, they _should be allowed to fail._"
3. "Physicians should be prohibited from owning medical care facilities of any nature that they could potentially refer patients to. Examples include surgicenters, laboratories, imaging equipment, etc. _This is clearly a conflict of interest and should be illegal._"
